## ABOUT
In here, you can find solutions for [*codility* Lessons for Programmers](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons). It is a good coding exercises for beginners and professionals alike (as they say, or maybe just me, "real world problems can make your coding skills rusty"). 

For the actual lessons and its task/s please refer their [site](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons) and sign up as well, if you haven't done so.

This is a *work-in-progress* as well. I'll try my very best to keep it updated (because you know, sometimes life gets in the way of my coding). Information and explanation about my solution can be found in the source code (as a comment of course). All solutions here got a 100% score after evaluation and I will only put solution that gets a 100% score in the future. Please keep in mind that I am not claiming that these are the best solutions, but these are the solutions that I came up with and that also works for me.

Happy coding!

## SOLVING TIPS
- If you didn't get a 100% score, try again. Review your code, optimize it.
- If you are stuck, retrace your steps. Check your code line by line.
- Try to solve it yourself. Only look here (or somewhere else) as a last resort or for comparison.
- Most importantly, ENJOY it!
